# Curecoin-Parser
This is a Parser for the Curecoin community, it will be updated to the supported Curecoin exchanges and various tax software.

To use this Parser with Altquick/Koinly, create/name a folder. Click on your trade history and select the arrow beside "When" so that the arrow is pointing up and reflects your oldest trade. Than copy & paste each page into a seperate text file, you can than Drag/drop your text file onto the .Bat file.

Run withdrawals first or second to *automatically delete* "AltQuickTemp.Csv".

*The script must be saved as ANSI*.

If you have any troubles drop into the Curecoin Discord.
